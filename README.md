# Machine-Learning-Classification-project
In this project I used python for data preprocessiong.
then, I used Machine learning different classification Algorithms to predict whether person will be aple to payoff the load or not using KNN,Decision tress,Logistic regression and SVM then I used Different evaluation metrics from sklearn module like F1_score , Log loss and jaccard_score for measuring the accueracy of prediction.
There were two used data sets one for the model training and the second were used in the model evaluation.
